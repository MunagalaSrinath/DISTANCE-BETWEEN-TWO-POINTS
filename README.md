# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Get the two values from the user
### Step 2: 
Assign the value of second variable to a temporary variable
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.jpg)
### Step 4: 
Assign the value in temporary variable to the first variable
### Step 5: 
End the program
### PROGRAM:
```

import math as m
l1=[10,6]
l2=[4,2]

d=m.sqrt((l1[0]-l2[0])**2+(l1[1]-l2[1])**2)
print("{:.2f}".format(d))
```
